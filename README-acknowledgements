Unfortunately, I am forced to maintain two different acknowledgements files. This is because the a recent request
to add to it is only valid from 2023 on, but we have many old papers in the pipeline. There is no way to generate 
a time-dependent acknowledgements list, although there is work going on by the FENCE team to implement something. 

For now we have two files:

acknowledgements.tex -- to be used on papers before 2023. 
acknowledgements_2023_01_01.tex -- to be used on papers from 2023 on. 

When modifying the acknowledgments, if it should be retroactive to older papers, then both of these files must
be edited. If it's only for recent papers, then only the 2023 version should be modified. 

MacBook [512]> diff acknowledgements.tex acknowledgements_2023_01_01.tex

< EPLANET, Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie Actions and ERC (European Union);
---
> EPLANET, Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie Actions, ERC and NextGenerationEU (European Union);
44c44
< GVA, XuntaGal and GENCAT (Spain);
---
> GVA, XuntaGal, GENCAT, Inditex and InTalent (Spain);

Note that both of these are "new" in the sense that mention of Russian agencies is removed. The version with the
Russian agencies present still exists: acknowledgements_full.tex. It has not been updated for 2023.

I'm renaming these two acknowledgements files:

acknowledgements.tex -> acknowledgements_2022.tex
acknolwedgements_2023_01_01.tex -> acknowledgements.tex
